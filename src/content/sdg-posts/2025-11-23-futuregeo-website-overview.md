FutureGeo is a lightweight, fast site designed to answer a simple question:

> *Where does geoscience make a real difference to people and planet?*

Rather than acting as a traditional blog or static brochure, FutureGeo is structured as a small, focused map of ideas that teachers, students, and practitioners can reuse.

## How the site is organised

- **Impact on global challenges** – cards that show how geoscience links to themes such as clean water, hazards, energy transitions, public health, and critical resources.  
- **Geoscience specialisations** – an expandable catalogue of fields, driven by a CSV, that connects day-to-day geoscience work with future-oriented applications.  
- **FutureGeo insights** – short, markdown-based posts and carefully chosen external articles that can be read on their own or referenced in teaching material, proposals, and conversations with collaborators.  

Each insight is stored as a simple markdown file with a small amount of metadata (title, date, author, optional image, and whether it should be featured on the homepage). This keeps the content:

- easy to extend without touching layout code  
- portable into slides, class notes, or other websites  
- transparent, so that future contributors can see exactly how a post is written and rendered  

## What FutureGeo is for
FutureGeo is not meant to be a comprehensive catalogue of everything happening in geoscience. Instead, it aims to:

- highlight **clear, concrete stories** where geoscience knowledge supports the UN Sustainable Development Goals  
- give students and early-career scientists **entry points** into unfamiliar areas of practice  
- offer educators **ready-to-adapt examples** that connect classroom topics to real-world decisions  
- provide a home for reflections that might not fit in formal papers, but still carry insight for others  

Over time, FutureGeo can grow into a living notebook of projects, resources, and ideas that show how earth science can serve communities, ecosystems, and future generations.
